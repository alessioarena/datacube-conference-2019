# Land change interoperability
## Outcomes
Jupyter Notebook
## Description
Demonstrate the interoperable use of Landsat and S1 for land change detection. Consider adding S1 bands to the PyCCD algorithm, or using S1 band thresholds along with Landsat indices (e.g. NDVI, EVI, FC) to detect land changes.
