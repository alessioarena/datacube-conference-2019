# Land cover classification, change and application
## Outcomes
Methods to feed LCCS from Landsat and Sentinel-2
## Description
In this task, you are asked to generate a classification of land covers according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) from continuous environmental layers available within the ODC environment. Focus will be on generating the Level 3 stage of the classification hierarchy, which differentiates vegetated cultivated or semi-natural/natural aquatic or cultivated from non-vegetated artificial and natural land and water categories. Further detail can be provided within these categories (e.g., on forests) but at a later stage (not included in this task).
