# State of the Forest Indicators
## Outcomes
Notebook covering one or more of the indicators in the description.
## Description
The Australian Government Department of Agriculture reports on the state of Australiaâ€™s forest every 5 years and the report integrates remote sensing data sources with individual reporting aiming to maximise consistency across the data sources. There is an intention to create a single methodology for target indicators that can be consistently applied over time. Three indicators from the report have been identified that could demonstrate the ease with which forest reporting can be done consistently across the continent using DEA products, and given the temporal extent of available data, it should be possible to quantify change at much higher frequency than the current five-year snapshot. 

The indicators are largely physical and could be implemented using a multi-source approach of radar and surface reflectance products. Validation of indicators that are created is available from previous reports at the following website: http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/forest-data.


### Indicator 1
Looking to classify the physical structure of Forest using changes between height classes crown cover and area proportions.
 
### Indicator 2
Looking to classify the growth stages of forest, classify regeneration, regrowth, and mature forests based on a combination of crown cover and area proportions.
 
### Indicator 3
Looking at quantifying the impact of natural hazards on the state of a forest, for example measure the burn area such as https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/news/-/article/sentinels-detect-and-monitor-forest-fires. Tasmania could be a good case study area.
